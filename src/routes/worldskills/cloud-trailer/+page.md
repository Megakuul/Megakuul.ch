- When filtering for `Resource name` and `Resource type` I don't see all events.

<Quirk score={4.2}>
    Don't use them for filtering! Prefer <b>Event source / name</b>. Resource attributes just refer to "references" which are NOT added by all service control planes (e.g. Cloudwatch Logs omits them so CreateLogGroup won't appear on AWS::Logs::LogGroup).
