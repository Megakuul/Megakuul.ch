## Watch Out 👀

- If you encounter `Failed to connect to your instance` with EC2 instance connect, ensure that a security group on the instance allows access from the EIC PrivateLink. Notice that for private connections the ec2-instance-connect prefix list does not work (kinda obviously as it is routed via PrivateLink).

## Quirks

- Console does not accept security group if the VPCs got entered manually. *"Please select a security group that has EC2 scope."*

<Quirk score={9.6}>
Add <b>"ec2:DescribeVpcs"</b> and <b>"ec2:DescribeSubnets"</b> access to the principal and select the VPC/Subnet from the dropdown or create the instance via cli.
</Quirk>


- `ec2:DescribeImages,DescribeVpcs,...` and many more cannot be resource scoped 

<Quirk score={6.7}>
Accept it, use <b>"Resource": "*"</b> and don't take this as an example for a professional API design. 
</Quirk>


- The EC2 instance console does NOT display security groups of secondary ENI interfaces attached after instance launch.

<Quirk score={10.5}>
Use the ENI console section to configure security groups.
