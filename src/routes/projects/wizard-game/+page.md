Rizzful python single player game letting the player fight against a vicious wizard.

## Purpose

This game was built as part of a school project where we had to develop some random shit interacting with a database.


## Implementation

I implemented the application in python with pygame, the reason for this was that the requirement of using a scripting language
(before you ask, they degraded javascript to be "no scripting language" so I had no choice).


It first used a sqlite database to store some irrelevant metadata (to meet the requirement of the database integration), later I updated it to use a `yaml` file for this instead so that you don't need to install a database to play it.


Recently, I refactored some things to let it run on real operating systems like linux.

## Lessons Learned

It was one of the first things I developed at all and a fun project (I had most fun creating the images).

Diving into the world of this game was one of the factors that sparked my interest in programming, even if I had no idea what I was doing at that time.
