Simple Password Generator, with a good-looking UI.

## Table of Contents

## Purpose

Before this project, I was only programming some small PowerShell Scripts. As I heard of Flutter, I was genuinely interested in trying it out. 
And my first idea was to just create a password generator.

## Implementation

In this project, I just tried out some widgets of Flutter and played around with it, so it was not really planned or thought through.

I deployed it on a nginx web server by simply exporting the Flutter Web project.

## Lessons Learned

I had a hard time with this project because I hadn't learned how to program before, but it was interesting and very helpful.
