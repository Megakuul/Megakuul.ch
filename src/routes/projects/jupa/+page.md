Fresh rebuild of the original jupa-thun website with cool parallax effects.

## Purpose

This project has really no purpose, the only purpose was that I wanted to create some cool animations with a svelte library `svelte-parallax` I found.

## Implementation

I tried to create a clean and simple page, leveraging the parallax effects to synchronize svg animation with scrolling.

Besides that, I rebuilt the other elements of the original website, incorporating some new daisyui components I wanted to try out.

The website is also built with responsiveness in mind and should also look quite acceptable on mobile.

## Lessons Learned

I did not learn very much building this website, it was more like a fun activity that gave me some worry free "I throw javascript on it, and it works" moments.
