The Statistic Calculator is a very simple web app that displays some statistical relationships in bulk.

## Purpose

In Mathematical classes, we covered the topic of stochastic. Since I needed to master it in preparation for the forthcoming examination, I decided to implement it using code.

## Implementation

For the project I wanted to use **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. 
After implementing some functionalities, I also brought in **Typescript**, as **JavaScript** misses plenty of functions that I knew from **C#**.

The project is quite straightforward, I created the user interface primarily using **HTML** and **CSS**, and then used **Typescript** to implement the mathematical functions.
To display the results in a Chart, I also used the **Chart.js** library from a **CDN** source.

## Lessons Learned

This project gave me a first insights in the Web-development world. I learned why **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** absolutely suck.
